## Release Notes Folder

Release notes are located in the **release-notes** folder of the plugin repo.

_Example:_ [anomaly-detection/tree/main/release-notes](https://github.com/opensearch-project/anomaly-detection/tree/main/release-notes)

## Naming Convention

OpenSearch plugins use the following release notes naming convention: `*opensearch-*<plugin repo name>*.release-notes-*<4 digit plugin version number>*.md`.

_Example:_ [opensearch-**anomaly-detection**.release-notes-**1.0.0.0-beta1**.md](https://github.com/opensearch-project/anomaly-detection/blob/main/release-notes/opensearch-anomaly-detection.release-notes-1.0.0.0-beta1.md)

## Categories

Release notes have the following categories, highlighted by a **Header 3** (`###`).

_Example:_ `### Bug Fixes`

### Breaking Changes

1. A change in one part of a software system that causes other parts to fail.

_Example:_ `* Add start/stop batch actions on detector list page ([#195](https://github.com/opensearch-project/anomaly-detection/pull/195))`

### Enhancements

A product change or upgrade that increases software capabilities beyond original client specifications, or an improvement on the existing featureâ€™s functionality.

_Example:_ `* Improve batch action modal loading state ([#216](https://github.com/opensearch-project/anomaly-detection/pull/216))`

### Bug Fixes

A change to a system or product designed to handle a programming bug/glitch.

_Example:_ `* Fix Jacoco coverage issue introduced in odfe 1.8.0 ([#134](https://github.com/opensearch-project/k-NN/pull/134))`

_Correct:_ `* Fix the out of memory issue ([#456](http:/#456))`       

## Automation

Create a GitHub Actions workflow to help draft release notes. See [.github/workflows/draft-release-notes.yml](.github/workflows/draft-release-notes.yml) for an example. This workflow is configured using [.github/draft-release-notes-config.yml](.github/draft-release-notes-config.yml).

See [release-drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) for more information. Note that this GitHub action utilizes labels on PRs. For more information on automating labels, see the [auto-labeling workflow](./WORKFLOWS.md#labeling-prs).
